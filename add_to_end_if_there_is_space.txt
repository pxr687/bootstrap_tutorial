# Back to The Fundamental Problem of Data Science

Remember our data scientists predicament? 

[common misinterpretations - the confidence level refers to the *method* of constructing
the intervals, but is commonly misinterpretted as referring to the the interval itself]

[You can use interval as a *guide* to where the population parameter may be - it is incorrect to
state that there is a 95% chance that the population parameter]

[If we were to repeat the sampling process multiple times and construct 95% confidence intervals from each sample, we would expect that approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.]
