- Adapt the scenario - remove ransomware aspect. The reason the data
scientist is limited to the sample of 25 is due to data privacy.

- Too much on samples/populations at the beginning, this can be sketched
rather than repeatedly emphasized

- Add in audience participation (budget time for this)

- Break down "plus or minus a bit" once we have the "spread" of the 
sampling distribution. 

	- Sample mean plus or minus SPECIFIC AMOUNT (calculated from sampling
	distribution)
	
- Maybe mention that bootstrapping "automatically" centres the confidence
interval on the sample mean

- When resampling is first introduced: ask what the audience think the 
problems might be from resampling from the sample.
	- this is to elicit the intuition about how resampling must be done 
	with replacement
