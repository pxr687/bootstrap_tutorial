# Part 1 - Data Science & The Fundamental Problem

## Definitions
Data science - the implementation of statistics using code and algorithms

**The fundamental problem of data science**: what we care about are populations, but all we (usually!) have access to are samples.

More spcecifically: we care about populations and parameters but all we have access to are samples and statistics
