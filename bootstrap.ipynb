She knows that her random sample is just one of numerous possible random samples, and thus her estimate is just one of numerous plausible estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "She wants to know: by how much could those estimates vary - e.g. *typically speaking, how wrong are the estimates produced by a sample of the size she took*? To answer this, it appears as though she needs to draw many other samples from the population, and compute a new estimates based on the each new sample. This would tell her how much estimates from a sample of the size she took tend to deviate from the population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This information would tell her how uncertain her estimate is**. She cannot get rid of the uncertainty, but she could quantify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But she doesn’t have the resources to go back to the population and draw other samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks as though the data scientist is stuck with the sample she has, and knows that it is uncertain whether her sample gives a *good* estimate of the underlying population parameter.\n",
